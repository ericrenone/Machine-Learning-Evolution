# Phase-Transition Dynamics in Systemic Evolution  
**From Information Primitives to Autonomous Latent States**

This project models how complex systems evolve from raw information to self-optimizing, autonomous states—using **mathematical principles** to abstract away biological or cultural specifics. It implements a **canonical simulation** demonstrating **phase-transition-driven autonomy**, including the "Broken Gate" mechanism (opportunity windows) that accelerate system evolution.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Key States

| State | Name | Role | Goal |
|-------|------|------|------|
| S₁ | Inference Primitive | Logic ("Software") | Maximize information density |
| S₂ | Persistence Substrate | Memory ("Hardware") | Stabilize structure |
| Ω  | Synthetic Latent State | Unified System ("Global") | Enable autonomous operation |
| G  | Gate / Opportunity Window | Phase-transition trigger | Modulate system growth |

### 2. Evolution Operators

- **Transport (S₃):** Maps inference logic to physical substrate.  
- **Gating (S₄):** Filters noise; controlled by parameter β.  
- **Optimization (S₅):** Refines substrate based on successful logic.

## Evolution Path (KWFR)

The system follows a **3-phase trajectory** from chaos to autonomy:

1. **Phase Alpha (Inference):** S₁ explores optimal configurations.  
2. **Phase Beta (Relaxation):** S₂ resists volatility, preserving memory.  
3. **Phase Gamma (Synthesis):** S₁ + S₂ → Ω; the system **becomes autonomous**.  

**Opportunity windows (Broken Gate events)** represent sudden substrate dips, accelerating autonomous consolidation.

## Visualizations

The simulation tracks system health with:

- **Evolution Plots:** Real-time tracking of S₁ and S₂ dynamics.  
- **Entropy Dynamics:** Balance between information (S₁) and stability (S₂).  
- **Transition Efficiency:** Measures S₂ → Ω mapping.  
- **Hyperbolic Mapping:** Concept clustering and latent manifold visualization.  

Real-time popups indicate **opportunity window triggers**, and final summary includes:

- Maximum S₁ activation  
- Minimum S₂ substrate  
- Mean gate G(t)  
- Cumulative opportunity events  
- Clear conclusions on autonomous synthesis

## Technical Details

- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Dependencies:** NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy  
- **Mathematics:** Shannon Entropy, Wasserstein Transport, Boltzmann Gating  
- **Reproducibility:** Set `np.random.seed()` for consistent results

## Output Metrics

- **Max Activation:** Peak information consolidation.  
- **Final Entropy:** Indicates system approaching autonomous stability.  
- **Cumulative Windows:** Number of phase-transition events (opportunity windows).
